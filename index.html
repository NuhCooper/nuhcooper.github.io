      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Nuh (Chris) Cooper, a passionate engineer with a focus on leveraging AI and data to create meaningful change. I hold an MEng degree in Electronic Engineering from the University of York and am currently pursuing a PhD in Electronic Engineering, with a focus on Responsible AI Business Strategies.
      </p>
      <p>
        At present, I work for Spirax Group, a FTSE 100 company, where I've had the privilege of leading multiple impactful projects. My journey in the world of data began with a passion for understanding how data drives decision-making and creates value. This passion has evolved into an expertise in data science, data strategy, and promoting data literacy across the business. I'm particularly interested in enhancing digital skills and improving accessibility to data, empowering colleagues at all levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also deeply enthusiastic about AI, both its potential and the ethical considerations that come with it. My work in AI ethics aims to ensure that new technologies are implemented in a way that is beneficial, fair, and transparent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of engineering and data science, I have a history in competitive sports. I was previously ranked 7th in England in amateur boxing. Competing at this level taught me invaluable lessons about resilience and overcoming setbacksâ€”after losing four of my first five matches, I persisted, eventually competing against some of the top amateur boxers in the country. Today, I enjoy boxing training for fitness, as well as running to stay active.
